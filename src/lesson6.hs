-- Because $ is right-associative, f (g (z x)) is equal to f $ g $ z x
-- Use the $ operator to rewrite the following functions' composition
-- sum (filter (> 10) (map (*2) [2..10]))
sum $ filter (> 10) $ map (*2) [2..10]
-- sum (map sqrt [1..130]) becomes
sum $ map sqrt [1..130]

-- (f Â° g)(x) = f(g(x))
-- Using function composition, map (\x -> negate (abs x)) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24] becomes
map (negate . abs x) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24]
-- map (\xs -> negate (sum (tail xs))) [[1..5],[3..6],[1..7]] becomes
map (negate . sum . tail xs) [[1..5],[3..6],[1..7]]
-- Composition does not work well with function having more than one parameter. We need 
-- to use currying. So, sum (replicate 5 (max 6.7 8.9)) becomes
(sum . replicate 5 . max 6.7) 8.9
--  Or, using the $ operator
sum . replicate 5 . max 6.7 $ 8.9
-- replicate 100 (product (map (*3) (zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] [4,5,6,7,8]))) becomes
replicate 100 . product . map (*3) . zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] $ [4,5,6,7,8]
-- Are we sure that the last form is really more readable?
